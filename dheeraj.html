<hr><h3><font color="#CC0000"><span id="Apple">Resignation from Apple</font> and <font color="#99CC00">Establishment of DCinc &copy </font> </h3>
         After Resignation from Apple as Head Administrator of Icloud he started to start up a company along with his friends from Apple.As Dheeraj was the
	main Heading member the company was named as<div class="dropdown"> <span>DCi</span> <div class="dropdown-content"><p>(Dheeraj Coding Inc.)</p> </div>which is the present the WOrld's largest Android, IOS and Windows 
	Mobile and Mainline App Development Sector and this Company at present holds patents of around 4500 mobile tech along with apps and 
	free-use license of around 34 websites of all kinds like the Web Development to Learning Language etc. 	
</div></span></div>
<hr><h3><span id="Dcloude"><font color="#99CC00"> Establishment of DCloud Inc.</font></h3>
           After earning huge Interests and Shares from the product and the Patents from DCi &copy.Dheeraj had a grand for Establishment of
Strong Cloud based Services for the Mankind to the access data everywhere and everytime which lead to the Creation of Dcloud <mark>(Dheeraj's Cloud Services)
</mark> .His main intention behind creation this Company was establishmentthe real power of cloud than as for Storage purposes.First 
Initative was <mark>Cloudnet</mark> (High speed Internet Connection through the power of cloud)Cloudnet the first initation of Dcloud became 
a Mass hit in Connectivity with really good speed and low costs of Internet.
THis massive hit held him to get a rise in shares of Dcloud.Then on 12 july 2020.Dcloud became <mark>Dcloud Inc</mark>.</span>

<hr><h3><font color="#CC0000"><Span id="DCloudd">Difficulties at the Dcloud Inc.</font></h3>

It was the time when Cloudnet was running at high peaks.Then under the Company's Board pressurized him to create still more new products or Ideas to gain 
profits.Then it leaded to creation of <mark>Dconnecti</mark> (Cloudnet wifi version extender).Even though the idea was good it was unable to connect to all 
Internet works but was only compactible to Cloudnet band.This looks like a slight problem but the problem arised at there as it not was as promising as 
Cloudnetiwired services.Then shares for the Dcloud Inc. falled to 5% just in a week when Cloudconnecti was released.But irony lies in the fact that Board members
reclaimed their shares and blamed all on him.Unable to resist the blame Board member had reduced the shares% for him.Denied the allowance for the data servers
service plan which was got to be actioned after release of Dconnecti .Then after he felt really disturbed and wanted the plan to come under complete establishment
as he was of that domain and Data Services was most desired at those days and huge Investment was needed for the service Initation which the board had to deny
at any cost as money got exhausted in lavis parties and failure product "Dconnecti".</span>
 
 <hr><h3><font color="#99CC00"><span id="MD"> Establishment of MD<sup>2</sup>ata Services(Mohit Dheeraj Data Services)</font></h3>
 Mohit (Vice president of Dcloud Inc.) best friend to Dheeraj from the Princeton University.Then on 6 april 2023 they both decided to start their own private data services 
 by the name of MD<sup>2</sup>ata SServices (Mohit Dheeraj Data Server Servies)named so this Services was joint venture of Mohit and Dheeraj Wealth that included creation 
of DNS Server and Data Server and Cloud Backups for better security of Data.Then the major share holder of this Data Services was Apple Inc. themself.
As after depart of Him and Mohit Apple Inc. Icloud was not that safe.So they wanted them to secure their data and thus making them to be major share holder
Then Facebook also biggest demander of DNS Server and Data Server clients as they needed the most to store their raw data in their Servers.
But Ironically Dcloud Inc. still was struct up on the Cloudnet and rejected the use of Cloudconnecti and couldnot come up new products to rise their shares
but every time they did so it just failed in the market.Dcloud Inc.was running out of shares and profits while MD<sup>2</sup>ata Services was running with
profits with active members from Apple and Facebook.Point to note that the <font style color="green">MD<sup>2</sup>ata Services</font> was a firm established 
by Dheeraj and is governed not under his company Dcloud Inc.It means profits from <mark>MD<sup>2</sup>ata Services</mark> soleily belonged to them only.
</span>
<hr><h3><span id="D"><font color="#99CC00">Conversion of MD<sup>2</sup>ata Services to D<sup>2</sup>ata Services && Dheeraj as the "interim" CEO of the Dcloud Inc.</font></h3>
Even though gaining huge profits under MD<sup>2</sup>ata Services .Dheeraj had the dream to do his domain work on DNS Server and Data Server and Cloud Backups 
for better security of Data under his home banner Dcloud Inc. Then Dcloud Inc. was running low and the company employees were unable to get proper wages because the
 the profits from MD<sup>2</sup>ata Services purely belonged to Mohit and Dheeraj.Then decided to buy to take that Data services as many Major Companies are after it
  Under the request Vice Head Dheeraj included <mark>MD<sup>2</sup>ata Services</mark> into Dcloud Inc. and renamed as <mark>D<sup>2</sup>ata Services</mark>
  (Dcloud Data Services) only under the conditions that Company recongises him as the "interim" CEO of the Dcloud Inc."INTERIM" means not under influence of 
  any terms and conditions which the board had to accept at any cost.</span> 
<hr><h3><font color="#99CC00"><span id="M">Creation of DMail and DChat</font></h3>
The Story is not completed yet after being the whole and sole Head of the <b>DCi &copy, DCloud Inc., D<sup>2</sup> Data Services.</b>He was unstoppable
and contributed his knowledge and Money for pretty interesting things.He is indirectily the father of <mark>DMail, DChat</mark> some of the most popularily

	  After the serving President of the D<sup>2</sup> Data Services, he sougth to the need for the much more reliable platform for the E-Commerce
	 Industry. Which does lead to the creation of the DStore.
